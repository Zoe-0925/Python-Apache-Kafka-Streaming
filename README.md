# Python-Apache-Kafka-Streaming
A python program that reads data from CSV files, streams the data with 3 Kafka producers, processes the result, and save it into MongoDB.

# Project Goal
To simulate processing big data streams from multiple sensors and saving the data analytics results to the MongoDB database.
The scenario is preventing bushfire through streamline data analysis by receiving data streams of the weather and multiple fire hotspots.

# Tech Stack
Python 3, Apache Kafka (Producers and Consumers), Apache Spark Streaming and MongoDB.

# Data Sets
○ hotspot_historic.csv

○ climate_historic.csv

○ hotspot_AQUA_streaming.csv 

○ hotspot_TERRA_streaming.csv
